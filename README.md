Project is part of ongoing learning in [udemy.com/course/nextjs-open-ai/](udemy.com/course/nextjs-open-ai/)

This is the second project in the course: "GPT Genius"

*ToDo:* (my own additions)
- Get Prisma migrations sorted
- Use environmental variable for token limit in Prisma Tokens Model?
- Implement a partial loading solution for tours?
- Add debounce for Chat search input?
- Add image fetchng to the Explore component
- Format ToursList to be fully responsive and not break cards when name of city/country is long.

The rest of what is below is original canned readme which may or may not change over time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
